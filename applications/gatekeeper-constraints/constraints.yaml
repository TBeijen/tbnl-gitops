# Goals:
# - Identify containers that do not have a memory request (but might actually need a significant amount of memory)
# - By setting memory request, have control over likelyhood of pod being evicted due to memory pressure
# - Effectively we want our end-user applications to be less likely to be evicted
# See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/node-pressure-eviction/#pod-selection-for-kubelet-eviction
